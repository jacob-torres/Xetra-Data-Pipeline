I'm a Python engineer residing on the outskirts of beautiful Denver, Colorado. I'm interested in statistics and machine learning, Languages, geopolitics, and travel.

## BACKGROUND

I'm legally blind, and I've had an atypical form of [RP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinitis_pigmentosa#:~:text=Retinitis%20pigmentosa%20(RP)%20is%20a,Complete%20blindness%20is%20uncommon) since birth. Starting around age 5, I began learning to read/write braille and travel independently with a cane. I was typing at an average speed of 70 words per minute by the time I started high school, using [screen-reading software.](https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/assistive-technology-products/screen-readers)

Mostly, my life is no different than someone with sight. I code and explore the internet with the help of screen-readers. Some things are more difficult, but many other things are easier for me.

## EDUCATION

After years of studying computer science and mathematics at [MSU Denver,](https://msudenver.edu/), I was forced to take an extended break from traditional university education because of Covid 19. I discovered [Bloom Tech (formerly known as Lambda School)](https://bloomtech.com/) in 2020, and am now a graduate in data science and machine learning.

## CAREER

In addition to several challenging personal projects, I was a data and machine learning engineer on [Scribble Stadium Arcade](https://medium.com/geekculture/scribble-stadium-bridging-the-analog-and-digital-39865975a954) until March 2022. I migrated nearly 1 GB of training image data from the GitHub repo to the cloud, and helped improve upon a Tesseract OCR model for hand-writing recognition.

I am now involved in the [Unlock Africa] Project](https://mbuyu.org/), building and fine-tuning a Google Vision OCR model for the translation of thousands of national documents into four languages.
