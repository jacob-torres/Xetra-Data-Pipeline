## BACKGROUND

I'm a software and data engineer residing on the outskirts of beautiful Denver, Colorado. I'm interested in statistics and machine learning, Languages, geopolitics, and travel.

I'm legally blind, and I've had a severe [eye condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinitis_pigmentosa#:~:text=Retinitis%20pigmentosa%20(RP)%20is%20a,Complete%20blindness%20is%20uncommon)
 since birth. Starting around age 5, I began learning to read/write braille and travel independently with a cane.
 Mostly, my life is no different than someone with sight. I was typing at an average speed of 70 words per minute by the time I started high school, and learning every new concept I could.
 I code, read, and explore the internet with the help of [screen-reading software](https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/assistive-technology-products/screen-readers),
 which has been my own window to the world. There are still some obstacles in my way, but I am unstoppable when I decide to conquer something.

## EDUCATION

After years of studying computer science and mathematics at [MSU Denver,](https://msudenver.edu/), I was forced to take an extended break from traditional university education because of Covid 19.
 I discovered [Bloom Tech (formerly known as Lambda School)](https://bloomtech.com/) in 2020, and am now a graduate in data science and machine learning.

During my roughly 5 years of software and data science training, I have worked on many scrum development teams to build and deliver applications. These include:

- [Scribble Stadium Arcade](https://github.com/BloomTech-Labs/scribble-stadium-ds): A web-based game targeted at children ages 8 to 12 to encourage creative tasks such as story-telling, hand-writing, and drawing.
- [Spotify Song Suggester](https://github.com/jacob-torres/Spotify-Song-Suggestor): A Django application which uses machine learning to recommend a playlist of songs based on a Spotify user's current likes.
- [Airbnb Optimal Price](https://github.com/jacob-torres/AirBnB-Optimal-Price): A Flask web application which uses a neural network to predict the best price for renting an Airbnb with certain features.
- [Housing the Homeless](https://github.com/jacob-torres/housing-the-homeless): An analysis of government data to determine the effectiveness of various housing programs.

## CAREER

In addition to several challenging personal projects like the [Xetra ETL Data Pipeline](https://github.com/jacob-torres/xetra-data-pipeline/), I was a data and machine learning engineer on [Scribble Stadium Arcade](https://medium.com/geekculture/scribble-stadium-bridging-the-analog-and-digital-39865975a954) until March 2022. I migrated nearly 1 GB of training image data from the GitHub repo to the cloud, and helped improve upon a Tesseract OCR model for hand-writing recognition.

I am now involved in the [Bestimate](https://nu-bestimate.web.app/) app, building and optimizing our data analytics infrastructure from the ground up! The goal is to help companies harness the power of business intelligence to boost their growth.
