I'm a 24-year-old data science student residing on the outskirts of beautiful Denver, Colorado. I'm interested in statistics and machine learning, as well as economics, geopolitics, and travel.

## Blindness

I'm legally blind, and I've had an atypical form of [RP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinitis_pigmentosa#:~:text=Retinitis%20pigmentosa%20(RP)%20is%20a,Complete%20blindness%20is%20uncommon) since birth. Starting around age 5, I began learning to read/write braille and travel independently with a cane. I was typing at an average speed of 70 words per minute by the time I started high school, using [screen-reading software.](https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/assistive-technology-products/screen-readers)

Mostly, my life is no different than someone with sight. I code and watch youtube videos with the help of screen-readers. Some things are more difficult, but many other things are easier for me.

It's easy for me, for example, to work for long periods of time uninterupted, my brain laser-focused on a task for hours until the problem is solved. I know my city like the back of my hand, and can navigate anywhere with only an address. I have little talents like these that may not be directly linked to my visual impairment, but I think it's likely that the way I learned to work through unique problems independently for all my life made me extremely good at doing it in general.

## Education

After years of studying computer science and mathematics at [MSU Denver,](https://msudenver.edu/) with plenty of breaks in between semesters, I decided that the traditional university experience was not my ideal path to a career. I discovered Lambda School's [data science program](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/data-science/) in 2020, and am now well on my way to a fulfilling career in data science and machine learning.

My first venture into the tech sphere was hesitant. Afterall, years of fruitless interviews and unanswered follow-up calls had caused me to give up on ever finding steady work. But just as politics and economics had done earlier, programming captured me. I loved it enough to change my major in college from political science to computer science, even though this degree came with a mandatory math minor. Math scared me, but I grew to love it too.

Right now I am familiarizing myself with data analysis and data engineering practices. I'm building a range of technical and team building skills, networking, and asking lots of questions.
