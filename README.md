# Xetra Data Pipeline

## Data Engineering with Deutsche Boerse Stock Exchange Data

This a small ETL data pipeline which uses the [Deutsche Boerse stock exchange public dataset](https://registry.opendata.aws/deutsche-boerse-pds/) to make transformations.

**Note:** The Deutsche Boerse Xetra PDS S3 bucket is no longer being maintained, and so current data may be unreliable.
 More stock exchange data sources are to be added in time.
