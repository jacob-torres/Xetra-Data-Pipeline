>Music is the universal language of mankind. --Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

Music is a bridge across lingual and cultural barriers. Even when a song is in a language you don't understand, emotions are easily conveyed through the sounds of instruments and voices. If you don't believe me, take a listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiIQtwuiV54) and tell me you don't know what emotion the singer is speaking to.

Growing up, I played the violin, the drums, and briefly, the saxophone. I've always had an ear for music. As I work, I listen to instrumental pieces: classical, low-fi hip hop, solo piano, ETC. When listening to songs with lyrics, I'm enchanted by clever rhymes and intriguing turns of phrase. I'm studying multiple languages, most namely Spanish, and I've grown tremendously by listening to songs in languages I'm learning.

This is all to say that I believe music is a great channel through which we can analyze humanity. Each region (and perhaps each individual country or city) has its own distinct musical flavor, so to speak. Much like the local cuisine, a lot of cultural significance lies in the trends of regional music. Cook a traditional meal for a home-sick immigrant friend, and they may cry tears of joy. The same may happen if you play them a playlist of popular or traditional songs from their country.

In our exploration of Spotify song data, we'll endeavor to uncover some of the secrets buried in the 1s and 0s of our favorite songs from all around the globe. Spotify is a fantastic resource, with a wealth of data from nearly all of the world's music. Included in our analysis will be regional pop, golden oldies, and classical music from as many regions as possible.
