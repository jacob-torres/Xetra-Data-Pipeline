I just completed an analysis of the most recent available data on homelessness in the United States, collected and provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD.)

Find the data I used in this analysis [here,](https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/3031/pit-and-hic-data-since-2007/)

and find the Google Colab notebook [here!](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gaTCKCk37ElCcl9m-uFt_rvt_InQ1TXt?usp=sharing)
